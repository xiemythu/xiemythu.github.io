Welcome to my website! I am a PhD candidate in the [School of Public Policy and Management](https://www.sppm.tsinghua.edu.cn/english/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/) in Beijing, China. I am also affiliated with [the Center for Industrial Developments and Environmental Governance (CIDEG)](http://www.cideg.tsinghua.edu.cn/column/Home) at Tsinghua University. In Spring 2025, I was also a [visiting PhD student]( https://www.climate.ox.ac.uk/people/mengying-xie) in the [Department of Politics and International Relations(DPIR)](https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of public policy and international relations, focusing on climate politics, transnational governance, and the sustainability of China’s overseas investment. I am particularly interested in questions related to the impacts of private regulation on steering participants’ behaviors, the political economy of climate regulation, corporate sustainability strategies, and the sustainability governance of China’s Belt and Road Initiative. My work has been published in journals such as *Journal of Comparative Policy Analysis*, *Global Public Policy and Governance*, *Public Administration and Development*, and *World Economics and Politics*.

I hold a double master’s degree in the Global Political Economy of China and Europe at the [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/) and [Fudan University](https://igpp.fudan.edu.cn/) in Shanghai, China. You can reach me at [xiemy22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn](xiemy22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn) with questions about my research.

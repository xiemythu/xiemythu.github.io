Welcome to my website! I am a PhD candidate in the [School of Public Policy and Management](https://www.sppm.tsinghua.edu.cn/english/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/) in Beijing, China. I am also affiliated with [the Center for Industrial Developments and Environmental Governance (CIDEG)](http://www.cideg.tsinghua.edu.cn/column/Home) at Tsinghua University.

My research interests lie at the intersection of public policy and international relations, focusing on climate politics, transnational governance, and sustainability of China’s overseas investment. I am particularly interested in questions related to the impacts of private regulation on steering participants’ behaviors, the political economy of climate regulation, corporate sustainability strategies, and the sustainability governance of China’s Belt and Road Initiative. 

I hold a double master’s degree in the Global Political Economy of China and Europe at the [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/) and [Fudan University](https://igpp.fudan.edu.cn/) in Shanghai, China. You can reach me at [xiemy22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn](xiemy22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn) with questions about my research.

Welcome to my website! My name is Mengying Xie, and I am a PhD candidate in the [School of Public Policy and Management](https://www.sppm.tsinghua.edu.cn/english/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/) in Beijing, China.

My research interests lie in the intersection between international political economy and public policy, focusing on global governance and international development. I am particularly interested in questions related to transnational climate governance and sustainable development.

I hold a double degree in the Global Political Economy of China and Europe at the [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/) and [Fudan University](https://igpp.fudan.edu.cn/) in Shanghai. You can reach me at  xiemy22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn with questions about my research.
